        Everybody knows the basic projects that a beginner goes through when
        learning a new programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to collect all of my projects into a single one when I
        relearnt React.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these projects were done by me, without following a tutorial.
        Although, as all programmers I was looking for help sometimes online but
        I always tried to improve and come up with a better and original
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The games and features are very basic but they really helped me get back
        on track with my unused knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
